## What is Parallax Effect?

The Parallax Effect is a visual technique that gives the illusion of depth by creating a sense of movement between foreground and background elements on a web page. It is achieved by moving different layers of content at different speeds as the user scrolls, creating a dynamic and interactive experience.

This effect has become increasingly popular in modern web design and is often used to enhance the storytelling aspect of a website or to add visual interest to static pages.

## How does it work?

The basic concept behind the Parallax Effect involves positioning multiple layers of content (images, text, graphics) on top of each other and then adjusting their scrolling speeds relative to each other. As the user scrolls, the layers move at different rates, creating the illusion of depth and perspective.

The closer a layer is to the viewer, the faster it appears to move, while the layers farther away move more slowly. This mimics the way objects appear to move in real life as you change your perspective.

## Demo

A live demo of the Parallax Effect can be accessed [here](https://example.com/parallax-effect-demo).

## Installation

To use the Parallax Effect in your project, you have several options:

1. **Download**: Download the latest release from the GitHub repository and include the required JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML.

2. **CDN**: Include the Parallax Effect directly in your HTML file using a CDN link.

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/parallax-effect.min.css">

<!-- JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/parallax-effect.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

To apply the Parallax Effect to your web page, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML.

2. Structure your HTML code with different layers of content that you want to apply the parallax effect to. For example:

```html
<div class="parallax-layer layer1">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
<div class="parallax-layer layer2">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```

3. Initialize the Parallax Effect by calling the JavaScript function:

```javascript
// Initialize the Parallax Effect
const parallax = new ParallaxEffect();
parallax.init();
```

4. Customize the parallax effect according to your preferences (see the [Customization](#customization) section).

## Customization

The Parallax Effect can be customized to fit your specific design requirements. You can adjust the speed of individual layers, change the direction of movement, or modify the overall behavior of the effect. To do this, you can pass an options object when initializing the Parallax Effect:

```javascript
const parallax = new ParallaxEffect({
  layer1Speed: 0.5,
  layer2Speed: 0.3,
  // Add more options here
});
parallax.init();
```

Here are some of the common customization options:

- `layerXSpeed`: Sets the scrolling speed of the Xth layer (0.1 to 1, where 1 is the fastest).
- `layerYSpeed`: Sets the scrolling speed of the Yth layer (0.1 to 1, where 1 is the fastest).
- `reverseX`: Reverses the X-axis movement of the layer (true/false).
- `reverseY`: Reverses the Y-axis movement of the layer (true/false).

## Browser Support

The Parallax Effect is well-supported in modern browsers, including:

- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Microsoft Edge (latest)
- Internet Explorer 11 and above (with limited support)
